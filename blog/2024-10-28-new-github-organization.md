Hey everyone!

I've finally come up with a brand name for all my Sui-related activities.

<!--truncate-->

Meet [Suiware](https://github.com/suiware), a new Github organization that now hosts all my open-source projects related to Sui.

I've also renamed the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/HuDPpXz4Hx) and created an [X account](https://x.com/suiware_) for the organization. 
The best way to support my open-source work now is to subscribe to these channels.

Thank you!
